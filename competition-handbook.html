                <p class="body-small" style="margin-bottom: 48px;">It is strongly recommended that lifters and coaches acquaint themselves with the <a href="/ipf-rules"> IPF Technical Rules</a>. Compliance with these rules is the individual responsibility of the lifter. </p>
                <h3 class="heading-m">Order of events</h3>
                <p class="body">The following will guide you through how a competition generally runs and what to attended to as a lifter.</p>
                <ul class="body" style="margin-bottom: 48px;"> 
                    <li>Two hours prior to lift-off, weigh-in, kit check, and rack heights will be available. Timings will be specified in the flight orders.</li> 
                    <li>Weigh-in concludes after 90 minutes, 30 minutes before lifting begins.</li> 
                    <li>Kit check and rack heights will stay open until approximately 5 minutes before lifting starts, but it's recommended to complete both right after weigh-in.</li> 
                    <li>It's advisable to begin warming up about 30 minutes before your scheduled lift-off time or when the preceding flight begins lifting.</li> 
                    <li>After all flights in a session finish squats, there will be a 10 minute break before the bench press begins, and a similar break between bench press and deadlift.</li> 
                    <li>Once all lifts are completed, the medal ceremony for the AM session will be held (if time allows).</li> 
                    <li>PM flights will follow the same procedure, with rack heights opening after the AM session's medal ceremony concludes.</li> 
                </ul>
