                    <p class="body-medium" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Please note that rules and their application may differ in other regional divisions, national, and international comeptitions.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="body-small" style="margin-bottom: 48px;">It is strongly recommended that lifters and coaches acquaint themselves with the <a href="/ipf-rules.html"> IPF Technical Rules</a>. Compliance with these rules is the individual responsibility of the lifter. </p>
                <h3 class="heading-m">Order of events</h3>
                <p class="body">The following will guide you through how a competition generally runs and what to attended to as a lifter.</p>
                <ul class="body" style="margin-bottom: 48px;"> 
                    <li>Two hours prior to lift-off, weigh-in, kit check, and rack heights will be available. Timings will be specified in the flight orders.</li> 
                    <li>Weigh-in concludes after 90 minutes, 30 minutes before lifting begins.</li> 
                    <li>Kit check and rack heights will stay open until approximately 5 minutes before lifting starts, but it's recommended to complete both right after weigh-in.</li> 
                    <li>It's advisable to begin warming up about 30 minutes before your scheduled lift-off time or when the preceding flight begins lifting.</li> 
                    <li>After all flights in a session finish squats, there will be a 10 minute break before the bench press begins, and a similar break between bench press and deadlift.</li> 
                    <li>Once all lifts are completed, the medal ceremony for the AM session will be held (if time allows).</li> 
                    <li>PM flights will follow the same procedure, with rack heights opening after the AM session's medal ceremony concludes.</li> 
                </ul>
                <h3 class="heading-m">Weigh in</h3>
                <p class="body">Weigh-in is required for all International Powerlifting Federation competitions at every level and must be conducted no more than two hours before lifting commences.</p>
                <div class="call-out" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    <p class="body-medium" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">You must sit at or below your weightclass. For example, a -93kg lifter must sit between 93.0kg and 83.1kg</p>
                </div>
                <ul class="body">

                    <li>Once inside the weigh-in room, you may chose to strip down to underwear and socks. An official will ask you to step on the scale for your weight to be recorded.</li> 
                    <li>If you miss weight, you can re-weigh if necessary until weigh-in concludes (30 minutes before liftimg begins).</li> 
                    <li>If you fail to make weight before weigh-in closes, you may still compete as a guest, but you cannot place.</li> 
                </ul>
                <div class="call-out" style="border-left: 3px solid blue">

                <h3 class="heading-m">Rack heights</h3>
                <p class="body">To speed up the order of lifting, we take rack heights before lifting commences.</p>
                <ul class="body" style="margin-bottom: 48px;"> 
                    <li>We'll assist you in determining rack heights between weigh-in and lifting, either on the platform or elsewhere for afternoon sessions.</li> 
                    <li>Simply set up as you usually would in the gym, and we can make height adjustments if necessary.</li> 
                    <li>If you need blocks under your feet while bench pressing, please inform the volunteer or official taking rack heights.</li> 
                    <li>Centre or side hand outs/lift offs can be requested while taking rack heights.</li>
                    <li>Use your squatting footwear for accuracy and to avoid surprised when lifting.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="heading-m">Attempts</h3>
                <p class="body">During the competition, lifters or their handlers are required to submit attempt cards for their second and third attempts.</p>
                <ul class="body" style="margin-bottom: 48px;"> 
                    <li>Each lifter will receive eleven attempt cards: three for squat, three for bench press, and five for deadlift.</li> 
                    <li>Attempts are submitted to a volunteer, seated at ‘the table’ near the platform. </li> 
                    <li>Cards must be named and signed before submission in order to be valid.</li> 
                    <li>Responsibility for submitting attempts rests with the lifter or coach.</li>
                    <li>A lifter can change the weight of their first attempt, either higher or lower, up to three minutes before the start of the first round.</li>
                    <li>After the opening lift, the lifter or their coach has one minute to submit the weight for their second attempt on the card.</li>
                    <li>Second round weights on all lifts and third round squat and bench press attempts cannot be changed once submitted.</li>
                    <li>In the third round of deadlift, two weight changes are allowed, provided the lifter has not been called to the bar already loaded with their submitted weight by the MC.</li>
